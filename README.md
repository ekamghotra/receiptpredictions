Receipt Prediction App
This application predicts the monthly receipt counts for the year 2022 using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. The app provides a simple web interface to display the predictions in both tabular and graphical formats.

Features:
LSTM Neural Network: Utilizes an LSTM model to predict daily receipt counts.
Web Interface: A Flask web application to display monthly predictions and a line chart.
Dockerized Application: Easy deployment using Docker containers.
Interactive Visualization: Presents data in both tabular and graphical formats for better understanding.

Prerequisites:
- Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
    1. Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
    2. Git: Installed on your system to clone the repository.
    3. Docker: Installed and running on your system.
    4. Installation and Setup
    5. Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/receipt-prediction-app.git
Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
bash
Copy code
cd receipt-prediction-app

3. Install Docker
If you haven't installed Docker yet, download it from the official website and follow the installation instructions:
Windows and macOS: Docker Desktop
Linux: Docker Engine

After installation, ensure Docker is running by executing:
bash
Copy code
docker --version

4. Build the Docker Image
In the project directory, build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:
bash
Copy code
docker build -t receipt-prediction-app .

This command does the following:
-t receipt-prediction-app: Tags the image with the name receipt-prediction-app.
.: Uses the current directory as the build context.

The build process may take a few minutes as it installs all necessary dependencies.

5. Run the Docker Container
After successfully building the image, run the container:
bash
Copy code
docker run -p 5000:5000 receipt-prediction-app

Explanation:
-p 5000:5000: Maps port 5000 of your local machine to port 5000 of the container.
receipt-prediction-app: The name of the image to run.
Using the Application
Accessing the Web App

Once the container is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:5000
You should see the Receipt Prediction App displaying the predicted monthly receipt counts for 2022.

Understanding the Output
Line Chart: Shows the predicted total receipts for each month in 2022.
Data Table: Provides the numerical values of the predictions.
Training the Model (Optional)
The app comes with a pre-trained model (trained_model.pth). 

If you wish to retrain the model:
Ensure Python 3

Check your Python version:
bash
Copy code
python --version
Install Required Python Packages

Install dependencies using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy torch

Run the Training Script:
bash
Copy code
python receipt_predictions.py

This script will:
1. Load the data from data.csv.
2. Train the LSTM model.
3. Save the trained model to trained_model.pth.
    - Note: After retraining, rebuild the Docker image to include the new model.

Project Structure
Here's an overview of the important files and directories in the project:

data.csv: The dataset containing daily receipt counts for the year 2021.
receipt_predictions.py: Script to train the LSTM model and save it.
trained_model.pth: The saved trained model file.
app.py: Flask application script for inference and displaying results.
templates/: Directory containing HTML templates.
templates/index.html: HTML template for the web page.
requirements.txt: Lists Python dependencies required for the app.
Dockerfile: Contains instructions to build the Docker image.
README.md: This file, providing detailed instructions and information.

To remove the Docker image:
bash
Copy code
docker rmi receipt-prediction-app
To remove stopped containers:
bash
Copy code
docker container prune
Docker Hub (Optional)

If you wish to pull the Docker image from Docker Hub (if available), you can run:
bash
Copy code
docker pull your-dockerhub-username/receipt-prediction-app
docker run -p 5000:5000 your-dockerhub-username/receipt-prediction-app
Replace your-dockerhub-username with your Docker Hub username.

If you want to use the application using your own data, replace data.csv with your own dataset. Ensure the data follows the same format:
csv
Copy code
Date,Receipt_Count
YYYY-MM-DD,1234567

After replacing the data, retrain the model by running:
bash
Copy code
python receipt_predictions.py

It is also posible to change the prediction period from 365 days to whatever you want. To change this:
Open app.py.
Locate the line fut_preds = 365.
Modify 365 to your desired number of days.
